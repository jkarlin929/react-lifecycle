# React, State, and Lifecycle Methods

### Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:

- React and React components
- Props and unidirectional data flow
- The immutability of props

### Learning Objectives

- Explain React state
- Describe the React component lifecycle
- Explain the most important lifecycle methods
- Implement a react component that fetches some data from the web
- Discuss React events

# React State

- **Props** are properties that one component passes to one of its child components. They only go in one direction, and they are _immutable_. 
- **State** allows us to add dynamic content to our components. Components can have local state that we can **set**. Every time a component's state changes, the component will re-render.

We declare state in our constructor, like this:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MovieDiv extends Component {
constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      title: null,
      releaseDate: null,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <div>The title is {this.state.title}.</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

We update `state` with the built-in method `setState`. So, if we wanted to update the title in our `MovieDiv` component, we would say:

```jsx
this.setState({ title: 'Finding Nemo' });
```

Let's add this to a function in our `MovieDiv`.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MovieDiv extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      title: null,
      releaseDate: null,
    };
    this.updateTitle = this.updateTitle.bind(this);
  }

  updateTitle() {
    this.setState({
      title: 'Finding Nemo',
    })
  }

  render() {
    console.log('render');
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>The title is {this.state.title}.</h2>
        <button onClick={this.updateTitle}>Update!</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

(Note that we have to use `bind` to preserve the context of `this`.)

### VERY IMPORTANT: How _not_ to update `state`

Never, ever, ever, _ever_ update `state` by saying something like:

```js
this.state.title = 'Finding Nemo';
```

Instead, you **MUST USE** the `setState` method, like we did above.

```js
this.setState({ title: 'Finding Nemo' });
```

We can also take a copy of the state object using _spread syntax_. For example, let's say instead of a string, the `title` property is an array: `[<h2>Star Wars</h2>, <h2>Finding Nemo</h2>]`. We want a new method that will add `Back to the Future` onto this array. In order to do this, we'll do something like this:

```jsx
addAnotherMovie() {
  const state = {...this.state};
  state.title.push(<h2>Back to the Future</h2>);
  this.setState(state);
}

```

(This is also helpful if you have a complex object in your state.)

The third way we can update `state` is by passing `setState` a callback function rather than an object.

```jsx
addAnotherMovie() {
  this.setState(prevState => {
    prevState.title.push(<h2>Back to the Future</h2>);
    return prevState;
  })
}
```

### Let's make another example!

I'll be building up to the `widgets-example-begin` app.

# React Component Lifecycle

![lifecycle Methods](./assets/lifecycle.png)

Lifecycle methods describe the timeline of a React component's existence. They allow us to do things based on how the page loads. Let's add a lifecycle method to our movies example:

```js
class MovieDiv extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      title: null,
      releaseYear: null,
    };
    this.updateMovie = this.updateMovie.bind(this);
    this.addAnotherMovie = this.addAnotherMovie.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('did mount');
  }

  updateMovie() {
    this.setState({
      title: [<h2>Star Wars</h2>, <h2>Finding Nemo</h2>],
    });
  }

  addAnotherMovie() {
    console.log(this.state);
    const state = { ...this.state };
    state.title.push(<h2>Back to the Future</h2>);
    this.setState(state);
  }

  render() {
    console.log('render');
    return (
      <div className="movie-info">
        <h2>Welcome to my movie app!</h2>
        <h2>The title is {this.state.title}.</h2>
        <button onClick={this.updateMovie}>Update Movie</button>
        <button onClick={this.addAnotherMovie}>Add Movie</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Let's add a few more lifecycle methods:

```js
  componentWillMount() {
    console.log('will mount');
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('did mount');
  }

  componentWillUpdate() {
    console.log('will update');
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('did update');
  }
```

Now every time we start the app, the `componentDidMount` method fires.

#### NOTE: In your react classes, the constructor should appear up top, followed by lifecycle methods, then your own methods, then the render method. This is a best practice.

Let's separate the movie title div out into its own component and add some lifecycle methods to it as well.

```js
  
  componentWillReceiveProps(props) {
    console.log('subcomponent will receive props');
    console.log(props);
  }

  componentWillUpdate() {
    console.log('subcomponent will update');
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('subcomponent did update');
  }
```

Now when we run our movies app and make changes, we can see at what point each lifecycle method is fired.

### Fetching data within a React component

If you need to fetch data when the component loads, you'd do it in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle methods. This ensures that the component loads quickly, without waiting for data -- for example, if the request loads slowly.

Let's add an API call to our movie example:

In `App.js`:

```js
componentDidMount() {
  axios.get('http://batman-info.herokuapp.com/api/batman')
    .then(res => {
      const batmanTitles = res.data.Search.map(movie => {
        return <h2>{movie.Title}</h2>;
      });
      this.setState({
        batmanList: batmanTitles,
      })
    })
}
```

Then we can use that data in the component's render method.

### Another example fetching data using lifecycle methods

Let's say we wanted to add the NASA pic of the day to our NASA widget. What are some ways we could go about doing that? Where could we make that call? There are a couple of different ways to do this:

- Load the NASA data as soon as the app mounts (`componentDidMount`)
- Load the NASA data when the NASA button is clicked and pass it to the child component (`componentDidUpdate`)
- Load the NASA data in the child component when its prop `widgetType` is `'NASA'` (`componentWillReceiveProps`)

# Recap!

![state](./assets/state.jpg)

`state` is an object that React watches to decide when to update the DOM.
